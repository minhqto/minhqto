### Hi there 👋 I'm Minh!

Wow I feel special for finding out this cool Github feature (aka found it off another github profile).

I'm a software developer that mainly works on full-stack web applications, and I've also work in mobile app development with Flutter.
I also love to learn about other front-end web frameworks, and I've also recently taken an interest in app deployment and the DevOps side of programming!
When I'm not furiously recompiling my code and trying to figure out why I have a segmentation fault in C++, I try and make sure my dog doesn't eat more shoes 🐶!

## Currently working on:

- Adding cool user-engaging features to https://mypalate.ca/
- Making sure I can reverse a linked list
