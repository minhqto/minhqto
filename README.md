### Hi there 👋 I'm Minh!

Wow I feel special for finding out this cool Github feature (aka found it off another github profile).

I'm a software developer that mainly works on full-stack web applications, and I've also dabbled in mobile application development with Flutter.
I also love to learn about other front-end web frameworks, and I've also recently taken an interest in app deployment and the DevOps side of programming!
When I'm not furiously recompiling my code and trying to figure out why I have a segmentation fault in C++, I play badminton 🏸, paddle on my SUP 🏄, powerlift 🏋🏽, and make sure my dog doesn't eat more shoes 🐶!
